2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
SYNTH-5#1 Warning
Mapped onto distributed RAM because of timing constraints  
The instance decoder/input_data_reg_0_127_0_0 is implemented as distributed LUT RAM for the following reason: The timing constraints suggest that the chosen mapping will yield a better timing.
Related violations: <none>

SYNTH-5#2 Warning
Mapped onto distributed RAM because of timing constraints  
The instance decoder/input_data_reg_128_255_0_0 is implemented as distributed LUT RAM for the following reason: The timing constraints suggest that the chosen mapping will yield a better timing.
Related violations: <none>

SYNTH-6#1 Warning
Timing of a block RAM might be sub-optimal  
The timing for the instance decoder/code_list_reg, implemented as a block RAM, might be sub-optimal as no output register was merged into the block
